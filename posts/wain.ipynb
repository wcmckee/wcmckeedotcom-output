      "Janet had to reach Alfred and reboot his system. She creeped closer to Alfreds still body. The dino sniffed the air. Janet stopped moving frozen. The dino continued walking. Janet rushed towards Alfred and grabbed his body. The Dino looked back and saw her moving away. He turned and bagan to give chase to Janet and Alfred. Scrabbambing up a tree Janet was safe from the dino. She had saved Alfred. The dino growed and circed the tree. It scratched the bark from the tree as it grew inpatienct. \n",
      "Janet reached for her backpack and revealed a cellphone. She dialed the number 6 3  2 1 4 5 1. Suddently the dino froze, it had been shutdown. Janet climbed down the tree, still holding onto Alfreds lifeless body. She stepped over the dinos body. Lifeless but the dino never was alive. It was another machine created to hunt her down. She had created them to help people, to make peoples lives easier. But they took her ideas and created evil. The Dark Shape was created by them. Janet never programmed her robots to kill people but others had taken the software and added kill commands. It had created great evil in the universe. \n",

      "The planet Earth population had dropped to just a few thousand people in a matter of days. The machines released a toxin into the oxagin which caused the humans to choke to death. It was a quick death, but it spread quickly and was extremely contagious. Within an hour of the toxin being released half of the worlds population was dead. Over the next twenty four hour it wiped out 99.9% of mankind. \n",
      "Some people that held a special gene were immune. These people were scattedd about the world. \n",

      "The toxic grew complex and inserted itself into the dispursion of time and then spread the mutated toxic to people in the future, where they had found a cure. This caused the cycle to happen again - 99.9% of the world population was dead in under 24 hours. \n",
      "The remaining human had to find a way to give the cure to a large amount of humans without the machines noticing. They relized that having the machines help them in the cure was useless. They machines would spread their knowlege of the cure to enemy machines which would then develop a mutated toxic that the cure was useless against. The humans worked on traveling back with the cure and stopping the toxic waas being created in the first place. \n",

      "Thirty years Noel Locksmart had been a prisnor in the house. He will never forget the night. It was just a standard robbery. Locksmart had recieved word of a computer scientice by the name of Elizebeth Goodwill that had developed software that allowed the replaying of events in the past. The system was complex but started with just one script when Goodwill was just six years old. It was a login and logout script. The first script was the login script. This created a JSON object that included firstname, lastname, date (04/Nov/2014), time (hr:min), reason, and comment. The logout script added to the JSON object logout date, time, and comment. She wrote the script in the programming language Python. Her father  -  Charlie MacDonald had taught her from an early age the basics of programming. She enjoyed it so carried on. At a four year old she was involved in setting up a programming club for children. This idea spread to other towns, cities, and countries. Goodwill would travel with her Father and give demos and talks on their software development. Goodwill went on to co-founder the software development, infomation security, robotics design company: Spike InfoSec.\n",

Turbon reached for his phone and hit enter. Three claws reached inside the cubord and picked up an onion each. The bench was a woodern bench. The claws dropped the onions on the bench then went back to the cubard to collect more onions. Several more trips back and forward then the claws switched into the next phase - cutting of the onion. The onions were lined up perfectly on the bench. Three rows, five collums. Fifteen onions. Chef knives snapped out of the claws of the device and started to cut up the onions. Each onion was cut in half, then quarters, and finally sliced. The onions were scopped up and droped into a pan of oil to fry.

      "'Thank you', the voice of Gardens replied. \n",

      "Jones terrified started moving backwards towards the door. He turned and began running towards the door. \n",
      "The knife traveled faster through the air.Janet Pears\n",
      "A cracking sound shoock the room as the knife impayed the brain of Jones. His head was attached to the door. Part of the knife was impayed into the door. It was a instant death. MacDonald didn't have a choice. He was on orders from Trist Gardens. If he didn't follow through and kill his assistant his whole families lives were in danger. \n",
      "'Clean this up', MacDonald spoke as he walked out of his office. \n",
      "He stood in the foylor. Light blue covered the area. MacDonald could see Janet in distance. She was interviewing a new comer. Alfred Bunnings his name was. MacDonald watched as Janet and Alfred shook hands and took a seat.\n",
      "'He looks like a good test subject', MacDonad spoke. \n",
      "'Test subject: Alfred Bunnings', the device beeped back. \n",
      "'Confirm', MacDonald confirmed.\n",
      "MacDonald continued to watch Janet and Alfred as they talked. \n",
      "'So tell me about yourself', Janet had the first question.\n",
      "MacDonald had known Janet since she was a toddler. He would push her on the swings in the local park. MacDonalds daughter Elizebeth Goodwill would also be swinging. \n",
      "The Black Cat sat and watched the swings, following the figures in the seats as they moved backwards and forward. \n",
      "'Black',  a voice behind called and The Black Cat twisted around.\n",
      "The Black Cat  moved towards the voice. A dark black shape stood in the distance pouring fresh meat into the cats contaiiner.\n",
      "'Thanks ma'am', The Black Cat spoke, he began eating the meat. \n",
      "The Black Cat was a prototype for the humonald bot. It was used for testing. Under the fake fur and skin was metal and wires. A raspberry Pi computer inside the model with a cell phone and audino connected to that. \n",
      "Human like personioltys were added to the computer. \n",
      "The speech \n",
      "The park ranger - Alfred Bunnings had created this one. He had printed the parts and soultered the robot together. Installing the software was easy - it was all in the software store. Bunnings also worked on scripts for Black. Today he was testing a script that made the robot smell and taste food. As people were pushing their children on the swing he ordered for a humonald robot to activate in the park and send off a signal to attract Black back.\n",
      "This script could be used in many areas but Bunnings was developing it so he could find lost or stolen robots. \n",
      "Many times people come into the Park and walk away with a robot. Sometimes I don't relize it. They thing they have made a new friend but really it's a computer belonging to the park. The Park gets an alert that a bot has entered an unauthorised area and sends back gps data. \n",
      "The Park gives the person a friendly phone call or email and offers to either pick the robot up or let the person return the robot themselves. As long as the robot is returned the Park is not worried. Once the robot is returned it's rebooted in order to clear memories of leaving the park. The Park does not want robots remembering what is outside The Park as it causes more robots wanting to leave the park. Rebooting them isn't a problem but there is better work that the staff could be working on - such as new features. \n",
      "Black purred as he ate the fresh meat from his bowl.\n",
      "The little girl on the swing with straight brunette hair hoped off the swing and ran toward Black. He purred louder as the girl - Elizebeth Goodwill patted Black. The adult continued to push the other child - a girl with blonde hair and a darker completion than Goodwill.\n",
      "The Farm had rows of vegetables growing. On the pathway around the veges walked humonald robots working on the garden. \n",
      "Bunnings walked past the onion gardens. He smiled at the group of humanold robots in suits discussing the Onion garden. \n",
      "'We need to speed haviousting up by 150% in the next three weeks', Bunnings overheard them as he walked past. \n",
      "The Onion Gardens were thriving. A cold and wet June month meant rain every day. The claw pulled the onion and dropped it into the crate with the rest of the onions that had been havested. \n",
      "The Claw moved fast, pulling another onion out of the ground in less than two seconds. \n",
      "Bunnings whisiled a tune as he walked past the Onion Gardens. Harvesting was excellent with the onions this year. They were experiencing a demand in onions and had increased the amount of The Claw that worked on the gardens. \n",
      "Bunnings entereded the carrot gardens. These parsely like vegetables added sweetness to the companies curries. Bunnings watched a The Claw plucked the carrots from the ground and dropped them in large containers. The next step for the carrots was washing, then it entered the kitchen.\n",
      "Bunnings entereed the tomatoe gardens. Rich red tomatoes grew on the stalk. In this garden the company used humonald robots as a majority over the claw. The humonalds were given custom arms that allows for careful picking of the tomatoes. The tomatoes were dropped into containers where they were washed and moved into the kitchen. \n",
      "The herb gardens were next. Here coroondir and other herbs were grown for the Indian Spice Mix.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Resturent was where customers could come and eat, or take away curry. Open 24hour/7days. They also offered a delivery service. \n",
      "Humanold robots greeted the customers and showed them to their seat. \n",
      "If they were takeaway they offered a room to sit and read magazines/books. A room that is filled with computers - these are running 24 hours and offer swipe card assess. Security cameras and drones operate in the building to keep an eye on everything. Secuirity drones analze the cameras for any unusual activity. Tonight they had found a human bot spiking the food with toxin. Camera 532 had spoted the crime. A Claw drone spoted the activity on the monitor. Alarms had already activated. Secutiry drones and bots headed towards the area. The human bot that was spiking the food activated a self return to base mode. It caused the bot to turn invisible and extremely tiny - the size of a mouse. The bot was still able to travel at fast speeds but it was also small like a mouse, and invisible. Devices had been developed that allowed for tracking of invisible units. The Claw Drones had invisible cloaking devices build in. This allowed them to become invisible for up to 48 hours. They can enter a sleep mode that allows them to run for months without needed to land. They are able to charge themselves remotly by downloading charge off a connection. This allowed more advance space travel by allowing humans to send robots which could self repair and charge. This allowed robots leaving earth to a far away planet that took thousands of years to reach. The robots finally reached the planet and sent back message to earth on the news. It took the robots 8,500 years to reach the planet. The news took 2,500 years to arrive. The message reached Earth on December 18th 3543. The humans that sent the bots into space and to the  planet had long since extint. Some of the older robots on Earth rememberd the mission and were able to decode the news file. It gave the robots great exciment that these robots had reached the planet and news had arrived back. The Robots of Earth created a time warp portal and linked to the robots on the planet. They ere able to travel between planets instantly. For the robots it felt like they had just woken up from a sleep. They work with the robots in order to get a toxic sent back in time to wipe out a certain group of humans that later develop a toxin that wipes out the human race. The toxin that is sent back is a success but spreads to forign targets - only activating again in 6 generations. \n",
      "When the toxin activates the nervious system in the throat stop working, causing the person to choke to death. A similar kill program was writen for the robots. It caused the robots harddrive to corrupt spreading the corruption to other systems.\n",
      "\"I'm feeling better now\", The Claw said to the humanold robot. The Claw was loading onions from the garden to the containers. These onions had been enjected with a toxin that would later cause much of the human race to die. The toxins had been placed in the onions by robots in the future with the help from a few remainings humans. Their plan was to wipeout a certain amount of humans, presuving human life in the future. Robots more in the future realized that this was a mistake and sent robots back in order to revirse the toxin.\n",
      "The only way for the toxin to not be created was to make sure the Spike InfoSec never waas founded. Humans were sent back in order to stop the foundation. Janet Goodwill was the number one target. The humans killed Goodwill many times but each time it was a clone. If the human form of Janet Goodwill is killed then the humans can insert the toxin into her system - sending it back generations. This simple exercise causes the company Spike InfoSec to never be founded. \n",
      "Alfred stood outside an empty building. He looked up. He remembers there was a Spike InfoSec sign hanging here. Instead it's a old video game store mixed with a coke logo, both fading and pealing off. The glass sliding doors didnt excist. A woodern door stood in front of Alfred. He turned the handle. It opened to a small foylor that looks like it was used for a small supermarket. Old broken trolies were scatted around the room. Cobwebs covered the room. A rat scatted accross the room. Followed by a black cat. Alfred walked down the hallway - it was filled with posters from ancient movies. They were faded and pealing off the room. Behind was a light blue textured wallpaper. the ground was a grey-blue carpet. It despritly needed a clean as dirt and grime covered it. \n",
